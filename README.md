# Product-Encyclopedia

The project is based on the idea of aggregating information about different famous fashion brands in one place for easy review. 

We applied what we learned in the course (SSE3150) into our application which has a friendly user interface. Products in our application can have various colors while visitors can easily get access to common features or commands like viewing products and searching for them whereas the staff can add products easily from their dashboard. 

In addition to the aforementioned functionalities, we applied a JSON function in our application to keep record of the userâ€™s browsing history in the system. The record can be reseted by the visitor and it will not be erased if the session of the visitor has ended.
